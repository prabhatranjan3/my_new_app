Multiprocessing Application

Overview

This Python application demonstrates the use of multiprocessing to perform various tasks concurrently, including: Downloading files from URLs. Processing JSON data by filtering based on specific conditions. Generating CSV reports from structured data. The program is menu-driven and includes realistic functionality for file management and task execution. Outputs are organized into an output directory.

Features

File Downloading The application downloads files from user-provided URLs using the requests library. Each download task runs in a separate process, enabling concurrent downloads. Files are saved locally with their original filenames.
JSON Data Processing Reads JSON files, filters the data based on a condition (priority == "high"), and saves the processed data into a new JSON file. Each JSON processing task is executed concurrently, speeding up batch operations.
CSV Report Generation Generates a CSV report from user-provided structured data. Data is expected to be in JSON format (e.g., a list of dictionaries with fields ID, Name, and Status). The report includes a header row and writes the data into a timestamped CSV file.
Output Organization All files (downloaded, processed, and generated reports) are saved in an output directory to keep the working directory clean and organized.
Program Structure

Task Functions These functions perform specific tasks: download_file(url) Downloads a file from a given URL. Saves the file locally with its original name or a generated name. Returns a status message (success or failure). process_json_data(file_name) Reads a JSON file. Filters the JSON data to retain items where priority == "high". Saves the filtered data to a new JSON file prefixed with processed_. Returns the output file name or an error message. generate_csv_report(data) Takes structured data (list of dictionaries) as input. Creates a CSV file with headers ID, Name, and Status. Saves the file with a unique name based on the current timestamp. Returns the file name or an error message.

Utility Functions Helper functions to support the program: display_menu() Displays the menu to guide the user through available options. create_directory(directory) Ensures the specified directory exists. Creates the directory if it does not exist.

Main Application Logic The application logic is implemented in the main() function: Menu-Driven UI: Guides the user to choose tasks (download files, process JSON, generate reports, or exit). Task Execution: For each task, user inputs are taken and passed to multiprocessing pools to execute the functions concurrently. Output Handling: Results from each task are displayed on the screen and saved to files.

Requirements

Software Requirements Python 3.7 or higher
Libraries The program requires the following libraries: Built-in: multiprocessing time random os csv json Third-Party: requests (Install using pip install requests)
Usage Instructions Step 1: Run the Application Execute the script in your terminal: bash python multiprocessing_application.py

Step 2: Choose a Task The menu provides the following options: ===== Multiprocessing Application Menu =====

Download Files from URLs
Process JSON Data
Generate CSV Reports
Exit ============================================ Enter your choice (1-4):
Step 3: Input Data For each task, provide the required input: Option 1 (File Downloading): Enter URLs (comma-separated). Example: bash https://example.com/file1.txt, https://example.com/file2.txt

Option 2 (JSON Processing): Enter the names of existing JSON files in the output directory.Example: sample.json

Option 3 (CSV Report Generation): Enter structured data in JSON format. Example: css [{"ID": 1, "Name": "Task1", "Status": "Done"}, {"ID": 2, "Name": "Task2", "Status": "Pending"}] Step 4: View Results The application will display task results on the screen and save output files in the output directory.

Code Workflow

Initialization The output directory is created (if not already present) to store all outputs.
Menu Options Option 1: Download Files Takes URLs as input. Spawns multiple processes to download files concurrently. Saves the files in the output directory. Option 2: Process JSON Data Takes JSON file names as input. Filters data (priority == "high") and saves to new JSON files. Processes each file in a separate process. Option 3: Generate Reports Takes structured data as JSON input. Creates a CSV report with ID, Name, and Status columns. Saves the report in the output directory. Option 4: Exit Exits the application.
Error Handling

Invalid URLs: Displays a detailed error message if a file cannot be downloaded. Missing Files: Displays an error if a specified JSON file is not found. Malformed Data: Handles exceptions for invalid JSON inputs while processing or generating reports.

Example Outputs

File Download Input: java Enter URLs to download (comma-separated): https://example.com/file1.txt Output (Terminal): arduino Process ForkPoolWorker-1 started downloading from https://example.com/file1.txt Process ForkPoolWorker-1 finished downloading file1.txt Download Results: Downloaded: file1.txt Output (Directory): lua output/ ├── file1.txt

JSON Data Processing Input: css Enter JSON file names to process (comma-separated): sample.json Output (Terminal): arduino Process ForkPoolWorker-1 started processing sample.json Process ForkPoolWorker-1 finished processing sample.json Data Processing Results: Processed Data saved to: processed_sample.json Output (Directory): lua output/ ├── processed_sample.json

CSV Report Generation Input: arduino Enter structured data for the report (e.g., [{'ID': 1, 'Name': 'Task1', 'Status': 'Done'}]): [{"ID": 1, "Name": "Task1", "Status": "Done"}, {"ID": 2, "Name": "Task2", "Status": "Pending"}] Output (Terminal): yaml Process ForkPoolWorker-1 started generating report: report_1691234567.csv Process ForkPoolWorker-1 finished generating report: report_1691234567.csv Report Generation Results: Report Generated: report_1691234567.csv Output (Directory): lua output/ ├── report_1691234567.csv

Future Enhancements

Support for additional file formats (e.g., XML, Excel). Progress bars for download and processing tasks. Logging system to track errors and task progress. Integration with cloud storage for remote uploads/downloads.

Conclusion

This application demonstrates how multiprocessing can be used to enhance the performance of common tasks like file downloading, data processing, and report generation. The modular design, error handling, and realistic outputs make it a practical and extensible tool for real-world applications.
